Installing Brew:
The following steps worked for me:

Clone it from github

git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew.git ~/.linuxbrew
Open your .bash_profile file using vi ~/.bash_profile

Add these lines

export PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
export MANPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/man:$MANPATH"
export INFOPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/info:$INFOPATH"
Then type the following lines in your terminal

export PATH=$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH
hash -r
Yes, it is done. Type brew in your terminal to check its existence.
```
